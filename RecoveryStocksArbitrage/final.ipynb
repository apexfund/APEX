    "# Part 1. Is the Monday Effect Real?\n",
    "## What is The Monday Effect?\n",
    "According to Investopedia.com, **The Monday Effect** is \"a financial theory that suggests that stock market returns will follow the prevailing trends from the previous Friday when it opens the following Monday.\" Then for a Security A, if A was trending down on Friday January 1st, the intraday percentage change $$\\mathrm{pct\\_change}(A, \\mathrm{''Friday, January, 01''}) < 0,$$ then the Monday Effect implies that the $$\\mathrm{pct\\_change}(A, \\mathrm{''Monday, January, 04''}) < 0$$\n",
    "and vise versa if the Friday experienced a positive percentage change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The History of The Monday Effect\n",
    "So I certainly am not the first person to ever look at this effect. **The Monday Effect** is a financial markets anomaly that was originally discovered and researched by Frank Cross in 1973 (Seen here: [\"Frank Cross' Research on The Monday Effect\"](https://dailyspeculations.com/scholarly/faj.v29.n6.67.pdf )). \n",
    "Here's the TLDR:\n",
    "* Cross looked at the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index from 1953 to 1970. 1953 is significant because it was the first year the market closed on Saturdays.\n",
    "* The probability that the SP500 Composite Index trended positive on a Monday given it also trended up on the preceding Friday is ~$48.8\\%$\n",
    "* The average percent change of the SP500 Composite on Monday's after a positive trending Friday was $0\\%$\n",
    "* The median percent change of the SP500 Copmositve on Monday's after a positive trending Friday was $0\\%$\n",
    "* The probability that the SP500 Composite Index trended positive on a Monday given it also trended down on the preceding Friday is ~$24.0\\%$\n",
    "* The average percent change of the SP500 Composite on Monday's after a negative trending Friday was $-0.48\\%$\n",
    "* The median percent change of the SP500 Copmositve on Monday's after a negative trending Friday was $-0.40\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Factors Impact The Monday Effect?\n",
    "To begin, **The Monday Effect**, is not a perfect estimator of where the market will be headed on a Monday. There are so many factors welded deep into the market that dictate where the market goes. These factors include, earnings, breaking news, supply and demand, even global economic and social conditions (just as seen with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent high volatility markets since then).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, part of this research will try to find out if we can dig a little deeper and find out if there are predictors built into the market. Frank Cross used the SP500 Composite Index to perform his research. I aim to replicate this trial first with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, an exchange-traded fund which tracks the S&P 500 stock market index, but using a more recent scope of time. The second goal of this project will be to breakdown the S&P 500 into the securities that form it and to use a Bayesian Classifier Algorithm to see if we can use the trends of each individual seucrity to predict how the overall index will move."

    "So, the Monday Effect technically is only defined in general as a pattern between Fridays and the following Monday. However, because of bank holidays, a Friday does not necessarily need to be the last day of a week and a Monday does not necessarily need to be the first day of the week, in this context Therefore, I had to come up with a different way to keep track of \"Friday\"-\"Monday\" pairings."

    "## What is Beta?\n",
    "Beta($\\beta$) is a measure of volatility of a security compared to the market as a whole, typically using the S&P 500 as a basis. Also note that $$\\beta = \\frac{\\mathrm{Systematic\\space Risk + Unsystematic\\space Risk}}{Systematic\\space Risk}$$ where **Systematic Risk** is the risk inherent to the entire market or market segmnet, in this case the SP500 and **Unsystematic Risk** is the risk uncertainty associated with an individual stock or industry. Here's a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta = 1$\n",
    "Indicates the equity is strongly correlated with the S&P 500 and does add any unsysteamtic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta < 1$\n",
    "Indicates the equity is less risky than the S&P 500 and typically moves more slowly than the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta > 1$\n",
    "Indicates the equity is more volatile than the S&P 500, adding unsystematic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta < 0$\n",
    "Indicates an inverse correlation relationship witht he S&P 500, i.e. moves opposite of the S&P 500. Without loss of generality, mirror the above scenario to see what negative $\\beta$ values mean.\n",

    "It is important to note that beta is not a constant quantity, in fact, it changes over time and as the price of the security fluctuates. Calculating beta is then directly related to our time horizon. For this analysis, I will be using Q1 and Q2 of 2022 as the time period of data to use. It then follows that all further analysis will be done on this same time frame. "

    "Calculating beta can be done in a variety of ways, but in essence, we are trying to find the slope of linear regression that best fits the data when we plot return of a benchmark vs return of security in quesiton. What is a benchmark? The benchmark here is whatever baseline metric we are using to compare our security against. Typically, this benchmark is an ETF of an exchange such as $SPY (etf for S&P 500), $ONEQ (etf for Nasdaq), or $IWM (etf for Russell 2000). For our analysis we will be using $SPY as it models the S&P 500, which is the market context we are aiming to focus on."
